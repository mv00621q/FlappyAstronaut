# Flappy astronaut
Flappy astronaut is a python game for the Raspberry Pi and 
the SenseHAT. It is a slightly modified version of the programm
at [raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/flappy-astronaut).

## How to
Put the SenseHAT onto your Pi and use the joystick to controll the astronaut.

It's just like Flappy Bird.
